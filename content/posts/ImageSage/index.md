# Background 
So the idea is simple: Generate a random image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) API and a random qoute currently using- [go-qoute](go-quote.azurewebsites.net).
And to get it deploy as fast as possible, you can see it [here](https://imagesage.vercel.app/) (also its [github](https://github.com/R0gue-one/Image-Sage/))

## An Observation !
I found it extremely amusing that even though these are two completely random image and qoute they somehow seem to fit very well ðŸ˜…


# Vercel 
While my aim was to learn how to use vercel I didn't know how to get the backend to work in vercel. Apparently its very easy all you need to go is create an `api` folder and put all your api endpoints there and vercel automatically handles these API routes.

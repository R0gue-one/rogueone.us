TLDR; 
First part is ðŸ’Ž .Second part is kinda forgettable. The ending was kinda underwhelming <br>
**Overall 8.8/10**


# Fellowship of the Ring
What to say about this the perfect setup for the series. From Aragon's introduction to Liv Tyler's to Boromir's sacrifice. For as much as expositions are bad the starting exposition wasn't that bad. The first act in shire was extremely wholesome. The Nazguls were a real threat throught the film. When we go on adventure with the fellowship we get know and love each of the characters yet the sense of tense stays throughout the journey from external forces as well as from within the fellowship. The climax is ðŸ¤Œ and the ending perfectly sets up the sequel.

**Rating: 9.2/10**

# The Two Towers
The main criticism of the 2nd entry would be that the overall narrative doesn't progress much further making it feel forgettable. Ofcourse Seans Bean's absence was quite notable making the overall movie feel like it's missing something. Despite it's shortcomings the move was an entertaining watch Saruman's army was threatning the battle scene was great and we also get a glimpse of how Gondor will react to Boromir's death. 
**Rating: 8.5/10**

# The Return of the King
The first act of the movie is very good but I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by the ending as I thought we would get to see Sauron in his full form. Also I have a few questions as to why didn't the elvish army or the the walking trees came to help in battle of Gondor or battle of Modor. Anyways the journey of gollum, Sam and Frodo was indeed very interesting, the battle of Gondor excellent, The return of the king was good too. But I feel like most great movies suffer from creating a satisfying ending and LOTR is no different. Also when you look at it was Gollum's greed and stupidity which destroyed the ring at the end of the day because Frodo at the end refused to throw it. It would also had been statisfying to see Aragon battle Sauron. But I appreciate the fact that the movie took it time to give proper sendoff to each of its characters. 

**Rating: 8.6/10**

Also I didn't know Eomer was Billy the Butcher from *The Boys* what's next Boromir was was Ned Stark ?


# Conclusion
Definitely one of the best if not the best trilogy of all time also one of the most rewatchable movies aswell. Comparing the three movies the first one is defenitely the winner. I haven't read the books but my only major complaint will the the ending. I am not a huge fan of high fantasy but this series is a masterpiece nonetheless and for a 20 year old movie it holds up pretty well in CGI department (the only places it aged was closeup of Gollum) in many was much better than the current superhero movies.

Overall I would give it **8.8** out of **10**.

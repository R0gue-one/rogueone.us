## Just a test article to see if things are working

I just realised I suck at this and I have an overthinking problem. 
At first atleast for 2,3 hrs I couldnt understand anything of what was going on in this codebase, even reading the documents didn't help much. It was only when I took a break and saw the docs calmly was I able to make sense of it, wow! anyways here's the two docs that got me going [from creator](https://n9o.xyz/posts/202310-blowfish-tutorial/) and [official docs](https://blowfish.page/docs/). 

After all is said and done I actually ended up quite liking this theme, but I need to move on now this has taken almost 3 days to get up :sneezing_face:

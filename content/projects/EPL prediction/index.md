We lost this hackathon probably because we spent 20 hrs trying to scrape the '23 season data rather than just using old dataset or because there was like 10-12 teams in our track. Anyways it was fun to build tho... 

Unfortunately it isnt deplyed anymore ðŸ¤• we'll try to fix that soon.

Meanwhile view in on GitHub: {{< github repo="devansh-srv/Hack-a-Sol" >}}

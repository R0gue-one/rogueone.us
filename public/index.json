It will not only help Corporations fulfill thier CSR but also prevent them from \u0026lsquo;greenwashing\u0026rsquo; all the while ensuring NGOs get proper funding\nHistory # Carbon trading originated in the 1990s as a market-based solution to combat climate change, starting with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, which introduced emissions trading among countries. It later evolved into voluntary markets and cap-and-trade systems, allowing companies to trade carbon credits globally. International Conference Center Kyoto How it works # NGOs will register on the platform and create Carbon Credits based on thier projects which will then be put up for sale.\nCompanies or traders can buy these can buy these credits from the NGO and resell them further if they wish to.\nFor every resell of a carbon credit, 10% of the transaction value is returned to the original creator of the credit (NGO). This mechanism ensures continuous funding support for the NGO\u0026rsquo;s environmental projects. Credits must be available for finite amount of time to prevent double spending, once the project is completed the credits will be expired and canâ€™t be sold further.\nOnce the NGO completes the promised project, it can expire all credits associated with that project.\nOnce the NGO completes the promised project, it can expire all credits associated with that project. The web app generates a certificate verifying the credit purchase and acknowledging the personâ€™s contribution to offsetting specific amount of carbon.

Suppose Company A exceeded this limit while company B emitted below its cap. B will recieve allowance in form of carbon credits which it can then sell to A so that A can also meet the cap requirements.\nThis method recieves criticism for promting companies to just buy off thier carbon emissions instead of moving towards reductions.\nIn carbon offset method, this is the method we base our project on, there need to be net reductions, for example when projects that help reduce carbon (like renewable energy and reforestation) will recieve credits from thier carbon reductions (1 credit for 1 ton of CO2 reduced) and then they can sell it to corporations which then can claim carbon reductions based on this. The problem that arises with this is that shell companies pop up which claim net carbon reduction through at best sketchy documentations. Famous example of this is JPMorgan, Disney buying carbon credits from The Nature Conservancy which issued carbon credits by saving forests that were never at risk read more about it here: Bloomberg\nThis case highlights how easily carbon credits can be abused.\nClosing remarks # While a blockchain solution will not solve all the problems with carbon markets it can certainly reduce them by using a decentralised verfication method for credit issue can reduce chance of corruption and being immutable will rule out chance of cheating and double speding. Aditionally we could utilize digitally signed IOT devices to efficiently estimate carbon reduction.\nHave a nice day !\nImage Credits # Feature image by Maxim Tolchinskiy on Unsplash\n","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/carbon-credits/","section":"Projects","summary":"Blockchain based carbon market","title":"Carbon Credits","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Project","type":"tags"},{"content":"This section contains all my current and past projects.\n!
